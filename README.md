# TODOs
An application that allows users to create and manage a to-do list.

## Task
**Required Features:**

The user should be able to create a new task and assign a description and priority to it.
The user should be able to mark the task as done.
The user should have an overview of all tasks and their status (completed/incomplete).
The user should be able to edit or delete an existing task.
The application should allow saving task data to a file so that it can be retrieved the next time it is run.

**Possible extensions:**

Add the ability to filter tasks by priority, creation date, or status.
Implement alerts (e.g. through notifications) for upcoming task deadlines.
Allow users to create and manage to-do lists (eg personal, work, school).

When creating a project, you can try creating classes for representing tasks, managing collections, working with inputs and outputs, and other basic Java concepts. You can also use OOP principles as I mentioned earlier and implement classes like Task to represent a single task and TaskManager to manage a list of tasks.
